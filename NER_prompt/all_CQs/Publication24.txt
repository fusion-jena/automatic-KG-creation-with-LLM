        Below are the competency questions and answers: 
CQ1: What methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., surveys, sensors, public datasets)?
Answer: The method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is a passive acoustic recorder, specifically a Song Meter SM2+ digital audio field sensor. This sensor records sound between 0 and 12 kHz at a 24 kHz sample rate. The sensor is equipped with a single omnidirectional microphone and is oriented horizontally at a height of 1 m. The audio files are saved in. wav format onto a SD card. The audio is recorded in computationally manageable chunks of 29 min of every 30 min, which are then divided into 1-min audio files.

CQ2: What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV)?
Answer: The deep learning pipeline uses audio data. The audio data is converted to a Mel spectrogram representation with 32 frequency bins, represented as rows in the spectrogram, using a temporal resolution of 21 columns per second of raw audio. Each column in the spectrogram is computed by running the fast Fourier transform on a section of the audio time signal. Each spectrogram column is computed from 0. 0928 s of audio (which corresponds to a window size of 2,048 samples), and has a Hann window applied. The columns are extracted from the audio signal at a frequency of 21. 53 Hz (or equivalently with a hop length of 1,024 audio samples, on our 22,050 Hz audio). Before use in the classifier, the values of the spectrogram S are converted to a log-scale representation, using the formula ln(A + B * S). For CityBioNet the parameters A = 0. 001 and B = 10. 0 are used, while for CityAnthroNet the parameters A = 0. 025 and B = 2. 0 are used. These parameters are chosen manually to emphasise biotic and anthropogenic sounds by visually inspecting the transformed spectrograms.

CQ3: What are the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.

CQ4: What are the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Flipping, Rotating, Scaling)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query.

CQ5: What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)?
Answer: The deep learning pipeline uses the CitySounds2017 dataset, an expert-annotated dataset of urban sounds collected across Greater London, UK. This dataset was used to train the CNNs, CityBioNet and CityAnthroNet, for measuring audible (0-12 kHz) biotic and anthropogenic acoustic activity in audio recordings from urban environments.

CQ6: What preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model (e.g., normalization, scaling, cleaning)?
Answer: The preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization is a technique often applied as part of data preparation for machine learning. It is a process that changes the values of numeric columns in the dataset to a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values or losing information. Scaling is a feature scaling technique in which values are rescaled so that they end up ranging between 0 and 1. Cleaning is the process of removing or correcting erroneous data from a dataset. %Context work consisted of a 32 × 21 × 4 tensor. Foundation, 2016) using theano v. 0. 9. 0 (The Theano Development 5.

Raw audio (1), recorded in the field, is converted to a spectrogram representation (2). A sliding window is run across the time dimension, and a window of the spectrogram extracted at each step (3). This spectrogram window is preprocessed with four different normalisation strategies, and the results concatenated. This stack of spectrograms is passed through a CNN (5), which was trained on CitySounds2017train. The CNN gives, at each 1- s time step, a prediction of the presence/absence of biotic or anthropogenic acoustic activity (6). Finally, these per- time- step measures can be aggregated to give summaries over time or space (7) of 1,024 audio samples, on our 22,050 Hz audio).

CQ7: What are the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation)?
Answer: The context does not provide explicit information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it is common practice in machine learning to split the data into training, validation, and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance. The split is often done randomly, but stratified sampling can also be used to ensure that the distribution of classes is similar in all sets.

Answer: The helpful answer is that the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to this query based on the given information. Final

CQ14: How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.

CQ15: What optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., SGD, Adam)?
Answer: The helpful answer is that the optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which optimization technique was used. %Query

CQ16: What criteria are used to determine when training is complete (e.g., validation loss plateau)?
Answer: The criteria used to determine when training is complete are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is common in machine learning to use validation loss plateau as a criterion for determining when training is complete. This means that training is considered complete when the validation loss stops decreasing and starts to plateau, indicating that the model is no longer improving its performance on the validation data.

CQ17: What are the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., dropout, L2 regularization)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.

CQ18: What is the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training?
Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to use a validation dataset. This dataset is used to evaluate the model's performance after each training epoch. The model's performance on the validation dataset is used to determine when to stop training and to prevent overfitting.

CQ19: Which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)?
Answer: The deep learning model is built using Theano v. 0. 9. 0 and lasagne v. 2 for machine learning, and librosa v. 4. 2 for audio processing.

CQ20: Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.

CQ21: What are the postprocessing steps involved after the model training (e.g., Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, Confusion matrix)?
Answer: The postprocessing steps involved after the model training are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the final layer of the model produces the prediction of presence or absence of biotic or anthropogenic sounds. The model's performance can be evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and Cramer's V statistic. The context also mentions that the predicted number of seconds containing biotic and anthropogenic sound for each half-hour period was averaged over the week to produce average daily patterns of acoustic activity.

CQ22: What metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)?
Answer: The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using precision and recall metrics. The fraction of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives were also computed, using the same threshold. These analyses were conducted in python v. 2. 7. 12 using scikit-learn v. 0. 18. 1 and matplotlib v. 1. 5. The experiments were run on a machine running Ubuntu 16. 04 with a 3. 60 GHz Xeon processor, 64 GB of RAM, and a 2 GB Nvidia GPU.

CQ23: What measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model (e.g., Diverse dataset, cross-validation, Stratified splitting)?
Answer: To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the testing dataset was chosen from the same sites as the training dataset, and it was found that this made little impact on the performance of the algorithms. Additionally, multiple human labellers were used to create a single annotated test dataset, which optimized the quality of the annotations. The resource intensity of this technique prevented it from being used to create the larger training dataset. The CitySounds2017 annotated training and testing datasets are available.

CQ24: What strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., random seed value)?
Answer: The provided context does not mention any specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the given context.

CQ25: What is the purpose of the deep learning model (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection)?
Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is to generate measures of biotic and anthropogenic acoustic activity. The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) and is part of the CityNet system. The CNN is trained on a large dataset of annotated audio recordings collected across Greater London, UK. The CNN is used to predict the presence or absence of biotic or anthropogenic acoustic activity in each 1-second chunk of audio. The predictions can then be aggregated to give summaries over time or space.

CQ26: What techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, Diverse data collection)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
