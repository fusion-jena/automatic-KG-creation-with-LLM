        Below are the competency questions and answers: 
CQ1: What methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., surveys, sensors, public datasets)?
Answer: The context does not provide explicit information on the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that data acquisition from the coral reefs has been facilitated by collecting images of the sea floor with the help of Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs).

CQ2: What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV)?
Answer: The deep learning pipeline in this context uses image data. The activation vectors of the first fully connected layer of a pre-trained VGGnet are employed as feature representations. The weights of this deep network are fine-tuned using the Benthoz15 dataset, which consists of expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian seas.

CQ3: What are the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation)?
Answer: The paper does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that each training image has 50 pixels marked with corresponding ground truth labels. This suggests that the annotation technique used is pixel-level annotation or semantic segmentation.

CQ4: What are the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Flipping, Rotating, Scaling)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.

CQ5: What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)?
Answer: The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are ImageNet and Benthoz15. ImageNet is used for pre-training the VGGnet, while Benthoz15 is used for fine-tuning the network.

CQ6: What preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model (e.g., normalization, scaling, cleaning)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and data augmentation. Normalization scales the data to a specific range, typically between 0 and 1, while scaling adjusts the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Cleaning involves removing or correcting any errors or inconsistencies in the data. Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the amount of training data by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping to the existing data.

CQ7: What are the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation)?
Answer: The data was split into training and testing sets based on the year of the images. In one experiment, the classifier was trained on two-thirds of the images from the year 2011 and tested on the remaining images from the same year. In another experiment, the images from year 2011 were used for training and the images from 2012 and 2013 constitute the test set. In the third experiment, the training set consisted of two-thirds of the images from the years 2011, 2012 and 2013, whereas the test set consists of all the remaining images from the same years.

CQ8: Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?
Answer: The paper does not provide information on the code repository of the deep learning pipeline.

CQ9: Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?
Answer: The data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query.

CQ10: What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?

CQ16: What criteria are used to determine when training is complete (e.g., validation loss plateau)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete.

CQ17: What are the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., dropout, L2 regularization)?
Answer: The provided context does not mention any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on the given context.

CQ18: What is the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training?
Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the classifier was trained on two- thirds of the images from the year 2011 and tested on the remaining images from the same year, and that the training set consisted of two-thirds of the images from the years 2011, 2012 and 2013, whereas the test set consists of all the remaining images from the same years. This suggests that the model performance was monitored by evaluating the classifier on a separate test set.

CQ19: Which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)?
Answer: The paper does not provide information on the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model.

Answer: The context does not provide information on the postprocessing steps involved after the model training.

CQ22: What metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)?
Answer: The paper does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the classifier achieved a classification accuracy greater than 90% in all of the experiments. Therefore, it can be inferred that one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model is accuracy.

CQ23: What measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model (e.g., Diverse dataset, cross-validation, Stratified splitting)?
Answer: The paper mentions that the weights of the deep network were fine-tuned using the Benthoz15 dataset, which consists of expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian seas. This suggests that the model was trained on a diverse dataset. Additionally, the paper describes three experiments conducted to evaluate the classifier, including training and testing on different subsets of the data, which could be considered a form of cross-validation. However, the paper does not explicitly mention stratified splitting.

Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is for coral reef classification. The activation vectors of the first fully connected layer of a pre-trained VGGnet are employed as feature representations in this work. The weights of this deep network are fine-tuned using the Benthoz15 dataset, which consists of expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian seas. The main contributions of this paper include a method to learn features using a CNN for coral reef classification and automatic annotation of unlabelled coral images and mosaics from the Abrolhos Islands in Western Australia.
