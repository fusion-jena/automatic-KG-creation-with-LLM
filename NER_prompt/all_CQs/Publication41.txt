CQ14: How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?
Answer: The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10^4. The model is trained for 15 epochs, and the training loss has converged by this time. The model was trained using an NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU, which took around one hour to train. The plot of training loss vs epoch is shown in Figure 7.

CQ15: What optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., SGD, Adam)?
Answer: The Adam optimizer is applied in the deep learning pipeline. %Explanation Explanation: The Adam optimizer is mentioned in the Methodology section as the optimization technique used to minimize the loss, which is measured by binary cross-entropy, with a learning rate of 10^4.

CQ16: What criteria are used to determine when training is complete (e.g., validation loss plateau)?
Answer: Training is considered complete when the training loss has converged. In this case, the model was trained for 15 epochs, by which time the training loss had converged. %Context: haze • partly cloudy • primary • road • selective logging • conventional mine • slash burn • water As a single image can have multiple classes in this dataset so, in the algorithm, all such classes were tried to predict correctly for each of the images. IV. DATA ANALYSIS Some basic data analysis was performed on the dataset which have been described in details below. A. Distribution of Training Labels Firstly, the histogram as present in Figure 4 showing the distribution of training labels was constructed. It has been found that the dataset is not balanced in nature, i. e. , all labels are not present in uniform quantity. Labels such as primary, clear and agriculture are present in signiﬁcantly more number than the other ones. Whereas, some other labels like slash burn, blow down and conventional mine are present in very less quantity. Note that in the dataset, a single image may have multiple classes. The histogram must be seen keeping this in mind. Fig. 4: Distribution of Training Labels B. Correlation Matrix The correlation matrix was plotted, as shown in Figure 5, to understand the occurrence of the classes with respect to each other. Here, redder is the label, more is the value of the correlation for any given pair of classes. After studying this plot, some interesting results were observed. Some of them are: The label primary is associated with almost all classes. This means that most chips have some degree of primary forests along with other labels. The label agriculture is also associated with a few labels like road, habitation and cultivation. 5: Distribution of Training Labels V. PREPROCESSING OF DATASET Even after converting to JPG, the dataset was quite large in size. It would have been computationally expensive to train the model on such a large dataset. Besides, the obtained dataset contained images of various dimensions. Hence, all images were resized to a standard size, in this case, 128x128 pixels. This is also an important step as it helps in speeding up the training. Since the downloaded VGG16 model did not contain the top layer, it was possible to train with images with dimensions (128x128x3) that were different from the dimensions of images used in the original VGG16 model (224x224x3). In this dataset, 40479 images for training and 40669 images for testing were used. Each image may be classiﬁed into multiple classes. VI. METHODOLOGY VI. METHODOLOGY In the proposed work, the VGG16 model has been used to classify images into various classes. Figure 6 shows the original diagram of the VGG model. 6: Distribution of Training Labels In the model, a batch normalization layer was added to the input layer and then fed to the VGG16 model. The last block of the original VGG16 model was removed and the output of the penultimate block of the VGG16 model was ﬂattened. It was then passed on to a softmax classiﬁer to present the output with respect to 17 classes. Here, 20% of the training data was used for validation after training. The architecture of this model is present in Table I. TABLE I: Architecture of VGG16 model Layer (type) input 1 (InputLayer) batch normalization 1 vgg16 (Model) ﬂatten 1 (Flatten) dense 1 (Dense) Output Shape (None, 128, 128, 3) (None, 128, 128, 3) (None, 4, 4, 512) (None, 8192) (None, 17) Parameter 0 12 14714688 0 139281 Here, the Adam optimizer [16] has been used to minimize the loss, which is measured by binary cross- entropy, with a learning rate of 104. Batch size of 128 was used here and this model was trained for 15 epochs. By this time, the training loss had converged. Using an NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU, this took around one hour to train. The plot between the training loss vs epoch is shown in Figure 7. 7: Plot of Training Loss vs Epoch VII. RESULT The following metrics were evaluated in our work Precision = T P T P + F P Recall = T P T P + F N Accuracy = T P + T N T P + T N + F P + F N With TP, FP, TN,FN being number of true positives, false positives, true negatives and false negatives, respectively. 1 precision + β F-Beta Score = Fβ = 1 β+1 1 recall precision. recall precision + recall 1 β+1 = (1 + β) Categorical Cross Entropy = n (cid:88) K (cid:88) −y(k) truelog(y(k) predict) i k In the experiment, a training loss of 6. 88%, training accu- racy of 97. 35% and testing accuracy of 96. 71% were obtained. Also, an F-beta score of 92. 69% was obtained. The F-beta score is a weighted harmonic mean of the precision and recall. An F-beta score reaches its best value at 1 and worst score at 0. VIII. CONCLUSION VIII. CONCLUSION In this work, a way to classify satellite imagery in an automated manner using deep learning with the help of the VGG16 model has been shown. High accuracy was consuming one hour while training with an NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU. This model can be successfully applied to track the changing land pattern in the rainforests of Amazon. This data about the location of deforestation and human encroachment on forests can help governments and local stakeholders respond more quickly and effectively. Besides, this model can be used to track natural calamities like ﬂoods, forest ﬁres, etc. IX. FUTURE SCOPE A few additions may be made to this work for improvements mentioned below: Using a larger neural network is likely to give a better result. Models like ResNet and Inception, which are deeper in nature may give better results than the VGG16 model. Also, the dataset may help in better classiﬁcation. In this work, it has been shown how resizing the provided image to 128x128 pixels can be made to obtain good performance. No preprocessing involving the texture and nature of the image itself was performed. increased preprocessing of Performing data augmentation to make the system more robust may be another way of getting better results. Since the satellite images may vary in terms of lighting effect, rotation, shifting, etc. , it may be a good idea to perform data augmentation to enlarge the dataset for better training. These things may be investigated in the upcoming future to improve the accuracy and robustness of this model.

CQ17: What are the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., dropout, L2 regularization)?
Answer: The paper does not provide information on the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, common regularization methods used in deep learning include dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents overfitting. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is a technique that adds a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages large weights and helps to prevent overfitting.

CQ18: What is the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training?
Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to use 20% of the training data for validation after training. The model was trained for 15 epochs, by which time the training loss had converged. The plot between the training loss vs epoch is shown in Figure 7.

CQ19: Which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)?
Answer: The helpful answer is that the deep learning model was built using TensorFlow. Final

CQ20: Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?
Answer: The deep learning model was trained using an NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU.

CQ21: What are the postprocessing steps involved after the model training (e.g., Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, Confusion matrix)?
Answer: After the model training, the postprocessing steps involved are metrics calculation and confusion matrix. Metrics calculation involves evaluating the performance of the model using metrics such as precision, recall, accuracy, and F-beta score. The confusion matrix is a table that is used to describe the performance of a classification model. It has four components: true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. These components are used to calculate the metrics. Saliency maps are not mentioned as a postprocessing step in the provided context.

CQ22: What metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)?
Answer: The following metrics were evaluated in our work: Precision, Recall, Accuracy, F-Beta Score, and Categorical Cross Entropy.

CQ23: What measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model (e.g., Diverse dataset, cross-validation, Stratified splitting)?
Answer: The query asks about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. Based on the provided context, the following measures were taken: 1. Diverse dataset: The dataset used in this work was derived from Planet's full-frame analytic scene products using its 4-band satellites in sun-synchronous orbit (SSO) and International Space Station (ISS) orbit. This dataset contains images with multiple classes, which helps in training a more generalizable model. 2. Cross-validation: The context does not explicitly mention the use of cross-validation. However, it is mentioned that 20% of the training data was used for validation after training. This can be considered as a form of cross-validation, as it helps in evaluating the model's performance on unseen data. 3. Stratified splitting: The context does not explicitly mention the use of stratified splitting. However, it is mentioned that the dataset is not balanced in nature, i. e. , all labels are not present in uniform quantity. This implies that the dataset was not split in a stratified manner, as it would have resulted in a more balanced distribution of labels. In summary, the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model include using a diverse dataset and performing validation on unseen data. However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of cross-validation or stratified splitting.

CQ24: What strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., random seed value)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values.

CQ25: What is the purpose of the deep learning model (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection)?

CQ26: What techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, Diverse data collection)?
Answer: The techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified splitting ensures that the distribution of classes in the training and validation sets is the same as in the original dataset. Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance the number of samples in each class. Oversampling involves duplicating samples from the minority class, while undersampling involves removing samples from the majority class. Diverse data collection involves collecting data from a variety of sources to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population.
