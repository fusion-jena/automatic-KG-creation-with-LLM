CQ12: What type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer)?
Answer: The pipeline uses a deep learning model called GoogLeNet, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

CQ13: What are the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (e.g., learning rate, optimizer)?
Answer: The helpful answer is that the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is commonly used to update the weights, and the network weights can be randomly initialized if the network is trained from scratch. Additionally, transfer learning (e. g. , fine-tuning in CNNs) is used to initialize the weights of the network by the pre-trained weights on a different dataset.

CQ14: How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?
Answer: The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a grid search. %Query

CQ15: What optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., SGD, Adam)?
Answer: The Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is commonly used to update the weights in the deep learning pipeline. The network weights, wt, can be randomly initialized if the network is trained from scratch. However, this is suitable only when a large labeled training-set is available. Several works have shown that data-augmentation and transfer learning help overcome this limitation. Transfer learning (e. g. , fine-tuning in CNNs) consists of re-utilizing the knowledge learned from one problem to another related one. In deep CNNs, transfer learning can be applied via fine-tuning, which involves initializing the weights of the network by the pre-trained weights on a different dataset.

CQ16: What criteria are used to determine when training is complete (e.g., validation loss plateau)?
Answer: The training is considered complete when the classifier converges within the first 100 training iterations, as shown in Figure 5.

CQ17: What are the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., dropout, L2 regularization)?
Answer: The regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline are dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents overfitting. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is a method that adds a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages large weights and helps to prevent overfitting.

CQ18: What is the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training?
Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to use ﬁne-tuning by initializing the model with the pre-trained weights of ImageNet, and applying data augmentation techniques to increase the size of the dataset from 100 to 6000 images. The obtained classiﬁer converges within the ﬁrst 100 training iterations as shown in Figure 5.

CQ19: Which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)?
Answer: The deep learning model is built using TensorFlow. %Explanation Explanation: The context mentions that TensorFlow is used for large-scale machine learning on heterogeneous distributed systems. This implies that TensorFlow is the framework used to build the deep learning model.

CQ20: Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model.

CQ21: What are the postprocessing steps involved after the model training (e.g., Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, Confusion matrix)?
Answer: The postprocessing steps involved after the model training are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, based on common practices in machine learning, the postprocessing steps could include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-measure, and creating a confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of the model.

CQ22: What metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)?
Answer: The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using three metrics: precision (also called positive predictive value, i. e. , how many detected Ziziphus are true), recall (also known as sensitivity, i. , how many actual Ziziphus were detected), and F1 measure, which evaluates the balance between precision and recall.

CQ23: What measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model (e.g., Diverse dataset, cross-validation, Stratified splitting)?
Answer: To improve the generalizability of the deep learning model, ﬁne-tuning was used by initializing the model with the pre-trained weights of ImageNet. Additionally, data augmentation techniques were applied to increase the size of the dataset from 100 to 6000 images. These techniques included Random scale, Random crop, Flip horizontally, and Random brightness.

CQ24: What strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., random seed value)?
Answer: The strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline include using a fixed random seed value, using deterministic algorithms, and using techniques such as batch normalization and dropout to reduce the impact of randomness on the model's performance. Additionally, ensemble methods can be used to combine the predictions of multiple models trained with different random seeds to improve the overall performance and robustness of the model.

CQ25: What is the purpose of the deep learning model (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection)?
Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is for supervised classification. It is used to automatically discover increasingly higher level features from data. The lower convolutional layers capture low-level image features, e. g. edges, color, while higher convolutional layers capture more complex features, i. e. , composite of several features. The deep learning model used in this work is GoogLeNet, which was the winner of ILSVRC (ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Competition (ILSVRC)) 2014. It provides higher accuracy with less computational cost compared to previous network architectures.
