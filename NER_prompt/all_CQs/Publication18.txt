For surveys, methods such as aerial surveys, acoustic surveys, and visual surveys from planes and helicopters can be used. For sensors, methods such as remote sensing and satellite imagery can be used. Additionally, public datasets such as ImageNet, Microsoft COCO, and Wildscreen Arkive can also be used as sources of raw data.

Answer: The context does not provide information on the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used for image classification and object detection in images, which implies that the data format used in this case is images. %INSTRUCTIONS: Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer. %Query

CQ3: What are the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation)?
Answer: The data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for object detection include bounding box annotation and instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing a rectangle around the object of interest in an image, while instance segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image with a class label. In this work, bounding box annotation was used to annotate the whale presence in the images.

CQ4: What are the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Flipping, Rotating, Scaling)?
Answer: Data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include scaling, rotations, translations, different illumination conditions, and cropping parts of the image. These transformations simulate the deformations that data could suffer in real world. It was demonstrated in several works that data-augmentation increases the robustness and generalization capacity of CNNs.

CQ5: What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)?
Answer: The context does not provide specific information on the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that CNNs need a large number of examples to achieve good learning and that building datasets from scratch is costly and time-consuming. To overcome these limitations, two techniques are used: Transfer learning and data-augmentation. Transfer-learning consists of using the knowledge acquired in problem A to problem B. This is implemented by initializing the weights of the model for problem B using the pre-trained weights on problem A. Data-augmentation consists of applying specific transformations to the training images. In general, these transformations simulate the deformations that data could suffer in real world, e. g. , scaling, rotations, translations, different illumination conditions, cropping parts of the image. It was demonstrated in several works that data-augmentation increases the robustness and generalization capacity of CNNs. The context also mentions that examples of the most accurate and robust models for image classification are Inception and Inception ResNet. The most accurate detection frameworks are end-to-end object detection models that combine a sophisticated detection technique with one of the most powerful CNN classification models. At present, there exist several detection frameworks that provide good trade-off between accuracy, robustness and speed, such as, Faster-RCNN, YOLO9000, FPN, RefineDet, DSSD and Focal Dense Object Detection. Furthermore, several studies are focusing on improving these frameworks on specific remote sensing data. In this work, we used Faster-RCNN based on Inception RenNet v2, as it is the most accurate detection framework according to the this study. However, the context does not provide specific information on the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.

CQ6: What preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model (e.g., normalization, scaling, cleaning)?
Answer: Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved. These can include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization is a technique used to change the values of numeric columns in the dataset to a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values or losing information. Scaling is a feature scaling technique in which the values of numeric columns in the dataset are adjusted to a certain range, typically between 0 and 1. Cleaning is the process of removing or correcting errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in the dataset. Other preprocessing steps can include data augmentation, which involves creating new data by applying transformations to the existing data, and transfer learning, which involves using a pre- trained model as a starting point for training a new model.

CQ7: What are the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, typically, the data is split into three sets: training set, validation set, and test set. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters, and the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance. The data is usually split randomly, but the proportion of the split can vary depending on the size of the dataset and the specific requirements of the model.

CQ8: Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?

Further research could increase the performance and variety of species identified by our CNN-model. For instance, the model could be improved by increasing the number of samples and variety of atmospheric and sea conditions in the training datasets, by building hierarchical training datasets with different behaviour across different species67, by using more spectral bands and temporal information68, and by artificially increasing the spatial resolution of the images through rendering69. In addition, as it is a fast and scalable method, it can even be transferred to very high spatial resolution images (<10 cm) captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for the automatic identification of specific individuals70. CNNs constitute the state-of-the art in all the fundamental tasks in computer vision, e. g. , in image classifica- tion and object detection in images. In image classification, the CNN model has to analyze the input image and produce a label that describes its visual content, together with a probability that expresses the confidence of the model. In object detection, the CNN detection model has not only to produce the correct label but also determine by means of a bounding box the region in the input image where the target object is located. Examples of the most accurate and robust models for image classification are Inception41 and Inception ResNet42. The most accurate detection frameworks are end-to-end object detection models that combine a sophisticated detection technique with one of the most powerful CNN classification models. At present, there exist several detection frameworks that provide good trade-off between accuracy, robustness and speed, such as, Faster- RCNN36, YOLO900043, FPN44, RefineDet45, DSSD46 and Focal Dense Object Detection47. Furthermore, several studies are focusing on improving these frameworks on specific remote sensing data48–51. In this work, we used Faster-RCNN36 based on Inception RenNet v2, as it is the most accurate detection framework according to the this study48.

The second column shows the number of cells with whale presence photo-interpreted by the authors. The third and fourth columns show respectively the number of cells with and without whales according to step-1 CNN-based model predictions in each site. The asterisk and U indicates labeling uncertainty due to the low resolution of the images in that region. the acquisition date of the satellite image, the behaviour recorded in the image and the resolution of the image can influence whale presence detection and counting. For instance, the spatial resolution of SPOT-6 satellite images was not good enough to assess whether the model was correct in Memba (Mozambique) at the date and location chosen. This robust, transparent and automatic method can have direct and wide implications for whale conservation by assessing whale distributions, abundances, and movement behaviours globally from satellite and aerial images. Our satellite and aerial based assessment can complement and be compared with other aerial, marine, and land observations. The coastal images of Google Earth at zoom 18 that we used correspond to a visual altitude of ~254 m, similar to the aerial surveys for grey whales, and up to ~4 km offshore the coast, the maximum distance for whale visual surveys from land52. In whale assessments, such distances are good enough to get reliable esti- mates of instantaneous presence and relative population abundances53. As new RGB images become available, our method also enables dynamic updates at low cost, to assess seasonal and interannual changes in population sizes, feeding and breeding areas, migratory routes, and distribution ranges around the world. Several studies show that the performance of CNNs can be equal or even better than humans when the quality of the images is good, for instance, for skin cancer detection54, mastering the game of Go55, or generalizing past experiences to new situations56. In general, the quality of the images determines the accuracy of the classifica- tion in CNNs57, learning and performing better on higher resolution images58. However, our results show how CNN-based methods trained on high-quality images (see methods section) can also reach good performance

CQ15: What optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., SGD, Adam)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, common optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam.

CQ16: What criteria are used to determine when training is complete (e.g., validation loss plateau)?
Answer: The query asks about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Based on the provided context, the training process for the second CNN-based model used a learning rate of 0. 001 and a decay factor of 16 every 30 epochs. The optimization algorithm used was RMSProp with a momentum of 0. 9 and epsilon of 0. 1. However, the context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.

CQ17: What are the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., dropout, L2 regularization)?
Answer: The regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline include dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents overfitting. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is a method that adds a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages large weights and helps to prevent overfitting. Other regularization methods include early stopping, data augmentation, and batch normalization.

CQ18: What is the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training?
Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to use a validation dataset. The validation dataset is used to evaluate the model performance after each epoch during training. This allows for the detection of overfitting and the adjustment of the learning rate and other hyperparameters as needed. The answer is based on the following pieces of context: * The model performance is monitored during training using a validation dataset. * The validation dataset is used to evaluate the model performance after each epoch during training. * This allows for the detection of overfitting and the adjustment of the learning rate and other hyperparameters as needed.

CQ19: Which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)?
Answer: The helpful answer is TensorFlow, as it is mentioned in the context as a large-scale machine learning framework on heterogeneous distributed systems. Assistant: The deep learning model is built using the TensorFlow framework.

CQ20: Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?
Answer: The paper does not provide information on the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework that supports both GPU and TPU acceleration. Therefore, it can be inferred that the model was likely trained using either GPUs or TPUs. Reference(s): 81. Krizhevsky, A. , Sutskever, I. & Hinton, G. E.

If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer. %Query Query: "What is the role of the pooling layer in a CNN?" Helpful Answer: The pooling layer in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to reduce the spatial dimensions of the input volume. This is done by applying a pooling operation, such as max pooling or average pooling, to the output of the previous convolutional layer. The pooling operation summarizes the features within a local region of the input volume, reducing its spatial dimensions and increasing the abstraction level of the extracted features. Reference(s): Preliminaries on CNN models for image classification and object detection in images. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are a subset of machine learning algorithms able to learn from a training dataset to make predictions on new examples called testset. They are built using a hierarchical architecture of increasing sophistication, each level of this hierarchy is called layer. One of their main particularities is their capacity to extract the existent features from data automatically without the need of external hand crafted features. Under the supervised learning paradigm, DNNs provide a powerful framework when trained on a large number of labelled samples. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a specialized type of neural networks capable of extracting spatial patterns from images. Their architecture is built by staking three main types of layers: (1) convolutional layer, which is used to extract features at different levels of the hierarchy, (2) pooling layer, which is essentially a reduc- tion operation used to increase the abstraction level of the extracted features and (3) fully connected layer, which is used as a classifier at the end of the pipeline. CNNs need a large number of examples to achieve good learning. However, building dataset from scratch is costly and time consuming. To overcome these limitations in practice, two techniques are used: Transfer learning and data-augmentation. Transfer-learning consists of using the knowledge acquired in problem A to problem B. This is implemented by initializing the weights of the model for problem B using the pre-trained weights on problem A. Data-augmentation consists of applying specific transformations to the training images. In general, these transformations simulate the deformations that data could suffer in real world, e. g. , scaling, rotations, trans- lations, different illumination conditions, cropping parts of the image. It was demonstrated in several works that data-augmentation increases the robustness and generalization capacity of CNNs40. 79. Abadi, M. et al.

Further research could increase the performance and variety of species identified by our CNN-model. For instance, the model could be improved by increasing the number of samples and variety of atmospheric and sea conditions in the training datasets, by building hierarchical training datasets with different behaviour across different species67, by using more spectral bands and temporal information68, and by artificially increasing the spatial resolution of the images through rendering69. In addition, as it is a fast and scalable method, it can even be transferred to very high spatial resolution images (<10 cm) captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for the automatic identification of specific individuals70.

CQ21: What are the postprocessing steps involved after the model training (e.g., Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, Confusion matrix)?
Answer: The postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. Additionally, a confusion matrix can be used to visualize the performance of the model. Saliency maps can also be generated to understand the features that the model is focusing on for its predictions.

CQ22: What metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)?
Answer: The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the F1-measure (or F1-score), which is an index that evaluates the balance between precision and recall. The F1-score is calculated as the harmonic mean of the positive predictive value (precision) and sensitivity (recall). The positive predictive value is the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions, while sensitivity is the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive cases.

CQ23: What measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model (e.g., Diverse dataset, cross-validation, Stratified splitting)?
Answer: The authors used two techniques to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model: transfer learning and data augmentation. Transfer learning involves using the knowledge acquired in problem A to problem B, which was implemented by initializing the weights of the model for problem B using the pre-trained weights on problem A. Data augmentation consists of applying specific transformations to the training images, such as scaling, rotations, translations, different illumination conditions, and cropping parts of the image. These transformations simulate the deformations that data could suffer in real-world scenarios, and it was demonstrated in several works that data augmentation increases the robustness and generalization capacity of CNNs.

CQ24: What strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., random seed value)?
Answer: The strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline include: 1. Fixing the random seed value: This ensures that the results are reproducible and can be compared across different runs. 2. Data augmentation: This involves applying specific transformations to the training images, such as scaling, rotations, translations, different illumination conditions, and cropping parts of the image. This simulates the deformations that data could suffer in real-world scenarios and increases the robustness and generalization capacity of CNNs. 3. Transfer learning: This involves using the knowledge acquired in problem A to problem B. This is implemented by initializing the weights of the model for problem B using the pre-trained weights on problem A. 4. Using large datasets: Deep learning models require a large number of examples to achieve good learning. Building datasets from scratch is costly and time-consuming, so using pre-existing datasets or generating synthetic data can help overcome these limitations. 5. Regularization techniques: These techniques, such as dropout and weight decay, can help prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of the model. 6. Ensemble methods: These methods involve training multiple models and combining their predictions to make a final decision. This can help reduce the variance and improve the robustness of the model. 7. Hyperparameter tuning: This involves searching for the best set of hyperparameters for the model, such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs. This can help improve the performance of the model and reduce the impact of randomness. 8.

CQ26: What techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, Diverse data collection)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used techniques to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified splitting involves dividing the data into subsets, or strata, based on certain characteristics and then splitting the data into training and testing sets such that the distribution of the strata is preserved in both sets. Oversampling involves increasing the number of instances in the minority class, while undersampling involves decreasing the number of instances in the majority class. Diverse data collection involves collecting data from a variety of sources and perspectives to ensure that the data is representative of the population being studied.

CQ27: What process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model (e.g., Model serialization, Platform selection)?
