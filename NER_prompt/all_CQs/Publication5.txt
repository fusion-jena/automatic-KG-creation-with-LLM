CQ6: What preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model (e.g., normalization, scaling, cleaning)?
Answer: Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved. These can include normalization, which scales the input data to a specific range, often between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. Scaling is another common step, which can involve techniques like standardization or min- max scaling to ensure that all features have a similar scale. Cleaning the data is also important, which can involve handling missing values, removing outliers, or dealing with inconsistent data. Other preprocessing steps can include encoding categorical variables, feature selection, or data augmentation. The specific preprocessing steps used can depend on the nature of the data and the requirements of the deep learning model.

CQ15: What optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., SGD, Adam)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.

CQ16: What criteria are used to determine when training is complete (e.g., validation loss plateau)?
Answer: The training process is performed for a number of iterations in which all the training data are exposed to the network until the loss function reaches its minimum value. In this case, the model score reached its maximum after approximately 5000 iterations with a NVIDIA Titan X GPU (3584 CUDA cores). The number of trainable parameters was 85,569 and the computational run-time was approximately 4 h with a training batch size of 1024.

CQ17: What are the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., dropout, L2 regularization)?
Answer: The regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline include dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents overfitting. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is a method that adds a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages large weights and encourages smaller, more generalized models. %Query

CQ18: What is the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training?
Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to use a randomly selected 20% of the training samples as validation data. This is done to determine the models’ performance and to minimize overfitting for unseen data.

Answer: To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the study used a diverse dataset and employed k-fold cross-validation with k = 5 for species with 50 or more occurrence records. The final suitability result for each species was averaged from the 5 results obtained from the k-fold cross-validation.

CQ24: What strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., random seed value)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. %Context Context: Due to the unique characteristics of neural networks, which solve problems by exploiting the hidden relationships inherent in multiple input variables, it was difficult to physically quantify the importance of the input variables. As an alternative, we performed a statistical feature importance test (SFIT) to explain which feature had the greatest significance in the species richness retrievals and to determine the optimized features in an operational retrieval system. For the SFIT, a single feature was randomly shuffled, while all the other features were kept constant. We iterated this process by changing the test variable. The feature importance shows the extent to which the model performance decreased with random shuffling. In this study, we used the root mean square error (RMSE) as the performance metric. 2. 5. Independent Validation of Species Richness Finally, we evaluated our two model results, S-SDMs and DL species richness, by comparing the species richness obtained from independent tree plot datasets from the Korea Forest Service [72]. We calculated species richness using grids with a 10 km resolution after sensitivity analysis at different resolutions. We then calculated the overall correlation and local correlations between the species richness from the independent datasets and the results from the S-SDMs and DL species richness model. For direct comparisons, the model Helpful Answer: The context does not provide information on strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. %Query

Answer: The context does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques used to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified splitting involves dividing the data into subsets, or strata, based on certain characteristics and then randomly selecting samples from each stratum. Oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority class, while undersampling involves removing examples from the majority class. Diverse data collection involves collecting data from a variety of sources to ensure that the data is representative of the population being studied.
