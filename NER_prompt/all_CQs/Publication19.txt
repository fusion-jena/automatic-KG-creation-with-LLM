Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training was to use a validation set. The validation set was used to evaluate the model performance after each epoch. The validation loss and accuracy were plotted to monitor the model performance during training. %Query

CQ19: Which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)?
Answer: The models were implemented using Keras (https://keras. io/).

CQ20: Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model.

CQ21: What are the postprocessing steps involved after the model training (e.g., Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, Confusion matrix)?
Answer: After the model training, the postprocessing steps involved include metrics calculation, confusion matrix, and ROC curves. The metrics calculated include accuracy, macro-F1 averages, and model size. The confusion matrix is used to evaluate the performance of the model, and ROC curves are used to visualize the performance of the model for each class. Additionally, the mean %CPU utilization and latency between capturing the image and doing the classification are also calculated.

CQ22: What metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)?
Answer: The performance of the deep learning models was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, macro-F1 averages, and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). The best performing model was Inception-V3 with a macro Average F1 score of 0. 93 and the smallest size of 175 MB. The ROC curves for the Inception-V3 model showed that it performed well for all classes, with the lowest AUC being for the "other" class (AUC=0. 98). The confusion matrix for the Inception-V3 model showed that most large errors occurred due to the model not being able to classify the ghost images accurately. The classes with labels (e. g. , Fox, Donkey, Goat, and Sheep) were classified quite accurately.

CQ23: What measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model (e.g., Diverse dataset, cross-validation, Stratified splitting)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the models were trained using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as the optimizer and that other hyperparameters like batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs were obtained using the grid search. Additionally, the models were implemented using Keras. The resulting hyperparameters for each model are shown in Table II. The models were evaluated based on their performance on a test set, as shown in Table III and Figures 6 and 7. The context also mentions that the data is highly unbalanced, and therefore, using SMOTE or similar data balancing techniques may help improve the results further.

CQ24: What strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., random seed value)?

Answer: The context does not provide information on the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the data is highly unbalanced and suggests using SMOTE or similar data balancing techniques to improve the results further. This implies that oversampling techniques like SMOTE could be used to address data bias in this case.

Answer: The trained deep learning model was deployed using TensorFlow Lite, which is a lightweight version of TensorFlow designed for mobile and edge devices. The model was serialized into a. tflite file and then deployed on a Raspberry Pi Model 4B. The Raspberry Pi was chosen as the platform because it is a low-cost, low-power device that is well-suited for edge computing applications. The Raspberry Pi was able to sustain a rate of processing 1 image every 2 seconds with an average latency of 1. 8 second/image. After capture and pre-processing, each inference took an average of 0. 2 Millisecond/image on the Raspberry Pi.
