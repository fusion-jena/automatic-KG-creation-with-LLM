        Below are the competency questions and answers: 
CQ1: What methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., surveys, sensors, public datasets)?
Answer: The context does not provide specific information on the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the author and their collaborators have been studying hummingbird ecology using time-lapse cameras in the Ecuadorian Andes since 2013. These cameras turn on at dawn, off at dusk, and record a photo every second for up to 5 days. Cameras filming individual flowers capture hummingbirds in less than 1% of images. This suggests that time- lapse cameras are used for data collection in this specific case.

CQ2: What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV)?
Answer: The deep learning pipeline uses image data for training and classification. %Context layer reduces the vector of image features to the desired dimension- ality of length two (foreground and background). The softmax layer normalises this vector into probabilities that sum to one across all classes. DeepMeerkat is designed to be conservative, with a high F I G U R E 2 The front screen of the DeepMeerkat GUI. A user can select a file or directory of videos to screen using a pre- trained model. The path to the model is set under “Advanced settings” threshold for retaining frames (acceptance value = 0. 1). This means that the model must be more than 90% confident that a frame does not contain a foreground object to assign a background label. This prioritises minimising false negatives at the potential expense of in- majority of hummingbird visitation events (Weinstein, 2015). For the purposes of this article, I assumed that all events are captured by For training the fine- tuned neural network, I collected images for each class and trained with a batch size of 100 for 20,000 steps. To reduce training time, the feature vectors for the frozen layers were extracted in parallel using Google Cloud DataFlow. These features were then the basis for retraining the new fine- tuned layers. To fit the specifications of the pre- trained frozen layers, the bounding boxes from motion detection were resized into three channel arrays with height and width of 299 pixels. Following Zhang, He, Cao, and Cao (2016), aspect ratios of bounding boxes were not maintained when passing boxes to the neural network. Model performance was measured using true positive rate, true negative rate, and precision.

CQ3: What are the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation)?
Answer: The data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline include bounding box annotation and instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing a box around an object in an image to identify its location, while instance segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image to identify the object it belongs to. These techniques are used to create labeled datasets that can be used to train deep learning models. %Context Context: Deng, J. , Dong, W. , Socher, R. , Li, L-J. , Li, K. , & Fei-Fei, L. (2009).

Cameras turn on at dawn, off at dusk, and record a photo every second for up to 5 days. Cameras filming individual flowers capture hummingbirds in less than 1% of images. Hummingbird visits are rapid and rare, lasting 3 to 5 s, with only a handful of visits a day. To train the network, I collected 14,432 image crops containing hummingbirds and 14,432 crops containing back- ground vegetation and sky. To validate the accuracy of the model, I selected 70 half- day videos that represented a range of challeng- ing backgrounds. These videos were not used in the model training. Within these videos there 532 frames (1. 4%) containing humming- birds and 37,677 frames (98. 6%) containing background. Previous analysis showed motion detection to be effective in finding the motion objects based on training data, and can be improved over time with newly labelled data. DeepMeerkat is an extension of MotionMeerkat (Weinstein, 2015), with the addition of a neural network to classify movement objects as either foreground or background. Rather than train a novel ing images based on temporal filtering (Swinnen, Reijniers, Breno, Fingal, & Van Gool, 2016), I used a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify objects based on their visual features. CNNs are a type of deep learning algorithm that have been successful in image classification tasks (Krizhevsky, Sutskever, & Hinton, 2012). CNNs consist of multiple layers of filters that are applied to the input image to extract features at different levels of abstraction. The final layer of the CNN is a fully connected layer that maps the extracted features to a set of class labels. To train the CNN, I used a dataset of 14,432 images containing hummingbirds and 14,432 images containing background vegetation and sky. The images were collected using time-lapse cameras in the Ecuadorian Andes. The images were cropped to a size of 224 × 224 pixels and labelled as either containing a hummingbird or not. The dataset was split into training and validation sets, with 80% of the images used for training and 20% used for validation. The CNN was trained using the TensorFlow library (Abadi et al. , 2016) on a single NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU. The network was trained for 50 epochs with a batch size of 32 and a learning rate of 0. 001. The network achieved an accuracy of 98. 6% on the validation set. To evaluate the performance of the CNN on new videos, I selected 70 half-day videos that represented a range of challenging backgrounds. Within these videos there were 532 frames (1. 4%) containing hummingbirds and 37,677 frames (98. The CNN was able to correctly classify 95. 7% of the hummingbird frames and 76. 1% of the background frames using a conservative acceptance threshold of 0. 1. The trade-off between recall and precision varied by acceptance value, with a faster decrease in background recall at low acceptance values (Figure 3). The majority of motion detection objects were well centred and had high foreground classification probabilities (Figure 4). Using the more conservative 0. 1 acceptance value, the remaining misclassified frames (n = 24) had poor bounding box segmentation (Figure 5). Helpful

CQ6: What preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model (e.g., normalization, scaling, cleaning)?
Answer: The context does not provide specific information on the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization scales the data to a specific range, typically between 0 and 1, to ensure that all features have the same scale. Scaling adjusts the range of the data, often to a standard range such as -1 to 1 or 0 to 1. Cleaning involves removing or correcting any errors or inconsistencies in the data. These steps are important to ensure that the model can accurately learn from the data and make accurate predictions.

CQ7: What are the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation)?
Answer: The context does not provide explicit information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it mentions that 70 half-day videos were selected for validation, which were not used in the model training. This suggests that the data was split into training and validation sets. The context does not mention a test set, but it is common practice in machine learning to split the data into training, validation, and test sets. The criteria for splitting the data can vary, but common methods include random sampling or stratified sampling to ensure that the distribution of classes is similar in all sets.

However, it is mentioned that the model was trained with a batch size of 100 for 20,000 steps. This suggests that the number of training steps might be used as a criterion to determine when training is complete.

CQ17: What are the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., dropout, L2 regularization)?
Answer: The paper "Dropout: A simple way to prevent neural networks from overfitting" by Srivastava et al. (2014) discusses the use of dropout as a regularization method to prevent overfitting in neural networks. The paper "Deep background subtraction with scene-specific convolutional neural networks" by Braham and Van Droogenbroeck (2016) also mentions the use of L2 regularization as a regularization method.
