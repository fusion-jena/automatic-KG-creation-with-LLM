        Below are the competency questions and answers: 
CQ1: What methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., surveys, sensors, public datasets)?
Answer: The context does not provide specific information on the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of electronic sensors and large scale sensor networks for generating petabytes of data each year for biodiversity monitoring.

CQ2: What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV)?
Answer: The deep learning pipeline uses audio and image data formats. The audio data is presented as spectrograms, while the image data is presented as image crops around the object of interest, with contrast enhancement and consecutive frame differences.

CQ3: What are the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation)?
Answer: The paper does not provide specific details on the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the system presents high probability events in a nonlinear-time presentation and allows analysis to repeatedly review complex or ambiguous events. The software is used to perform three specific tasks: (1) tools for audio and image data exploration to search for expected species and flag unknown or unexpected events, (2) creating labeled datasets to train and refine DL models, and (3) manually reviewing and auditing the output of existing DL models trained to classify events of interest. These tasks suggest that the data annotation techniques used may include labeling events of interest, flagging unknown or unexpected events, and possibly using bounding boxes or instance segmentation for image data. However, the paper does not provide explicit confirmation of these techniques.

CQ4: What are the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Flipping, Rotating, Scaling)?
Answer: The provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query.

CQ5: What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)?
Answer: The paper does not explicitly mention the use of any specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention that the deep learning pipeline uses large amounts of labeled data produced by analysts using the UI. This data is used to classify dozens of species signals and event types across ongoing projects. The paper also mentions the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep feed forward neural networks (DNNs) to audio spectrogram and image data. This suggests that the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are likely audio and image data related to biodiversity monitoring.

CQ6: What preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model (e.g., normalization, scaling, cleaning)?
Answer: The context does not provide specific information on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and augmentation of the data. Normalization and scaling help to bring the data to a similar scale, cleaning helps to remove any noise or irrelevant data, and augmentation helps to increase the size of the dataset.

Answer: The provided context does not mention any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.

CQ18: What is the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training?
Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to use a validation set to evaluate the model's performance after each epoch. The validation set is a subset of the training data that is not used to train the model, but only to evaluate its performance. This allows the model to be evaluated on data that it has not seen before, which can help to prevent overfitting. Additionally, the validation set can be used to tune the model's hyperparameters, such as the learning rate or the number of layers in the network.
