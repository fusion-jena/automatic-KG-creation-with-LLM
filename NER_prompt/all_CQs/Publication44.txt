Answer: To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, data augmentation techniques such as flipping and rotation were applied to the training images. This helped the model to generalize better as leaves were expected to be in different orientations, sizes, and locations. Additionally, the model was trained with a batch size of 32 images per iteration and applied binary cross-entropy as the loss function. The input images were resized to 300 × 300 resolution and trained for 100 epochs with an Adam optimizer at a learning rate of 1 × 10−4.

Answer: The provided context does not mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, common techniques used to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified splitting involves splitting the data into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes in both sets. Oversampling involves increasing the number of instances in the minority class, while undersampling involves decreasing the number of instances in the majority class. Diverse data collection involves collecting data from a variety of sources to ensure that the model is trained on a diverse set of examples.
