        Below are the competency questions and answers: 
CQ1: What methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., surveys, sensors, public datasets)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.

CQ2: What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV)?
Answer: The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images.

CQ3: What are the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation)?
Answer: The data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline include bounding box annotation and instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing a box around the object of interest in an image, while instance segmentation involves drawing a precise boundary around the object of interest. The Sashimi toolkit uses the Mask R- CNN architecture, which is an extension of the Faster R- CNN algorithm, to perform instance segmentation. This allows the model to not only detect the presence or absence of a target in an image but also to isolate the specific pixels encapsulating that target. The model is trained using transfer learning against the 328,000 image COCO dataset.

CQ4: What are the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Flipping, Rotating, Scaling)?
Answer: The data augmentation technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is flipping 50% of the images in the left-right orientation to increase the robustness of the neural network.

CQ5: What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)?
Answer: The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is the 328,000 image COCO dataset (Lin et al. , 2014).

CQ6: What preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model (e.g., normalization, scaling, cleaning)?
Answer: The context does not provide specific information on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves scaling the input data to a specific range, typically between 0 and 1. Scaling involves adjusting the range of the input data to improve the performance of the model. Cleaning involves removing or correcting any errors or inconsistencies in the input data.

CQ7: What are the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation)?
Answer: The dataset was randomly divided into training and validation sets, with approximately 80% of the data used for training and 20% for validation. The specific numbers are not mentioned in the context, but it is stated that there were 720 images for training and 190 for validation.

CQ12: What type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer)?
Answer: The pipeline uses a Mask R-CNN model, which is a type of deep learning model that is an extension of the Faster R-CNN algorithm for generating regions of interest. Mask R-CNN not only detects a target object in an image but also rapidly detects the pixel-level target region of interest, outputting a high-resolution segmentation contour reflecting the specific boundaries of the location of the target object within the image.

CQ13: What are the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (e.g., learning rate, optimizer)?
Answer: The deep learning model used a learning rate of 0. 001 for stages 1 and 2, and a learning rate of 0. 0001 for stage 3. The model also used a weight decay of 0. 0001, learning momentum of 0. 9, and image augmentation by flipping 50% of the images in the left-right orientation. The model was trained for 160 epochs over three stages.

CQ14: How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?

Answer: After the model training, the postprocessing steps involved in the Sashimi toolkit include using the trained model to segment new images, evaluating the segmentation performance using metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) and pixel accuracy, and visualizing the segmentation results using tools such as saliency maps. The toolkit also includes a script to aid users in qualitatively and quantitatively assessing model performance for complementary sets of automatically and manually segmented images. However, the specific postprocessing steps may vary depending on the use case and the desired level of detail in the analysis.

The dataset was randomly divided into training and validation sets (ntrain = 720, nvalidation = 190; approximately 80% train, 20% validation). The model was trained for 160 epochs over three stages, with different learning rates and weight decay. Image augmentation was also used by flipping 50% of the images in the left-right orientation to increase the robustness of the neural network. Model training took approximately 8 hr to complete.
