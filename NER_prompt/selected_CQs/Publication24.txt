CQ: What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g, image, audio, video, csv)?
Answer: The deep learning pipeline uses audio data. The audio data is converted to a Mel spectrogram representation with 32 frequency bins, represented as rows in the spectrogram, using a temporal resolution of 21 columns per second of raw audio. Each column in the spectrogram is computed by running the fast Fourier transform on a section of the audio time signal. Each spectrogram column is computed from 0. 0928 s of audio (which corresponds to a window size of 2,048 samples), and has a Hann window applied. The columns are extracted from the audio signal at a frequency of 21. 53 Hz (or equivalently with a hop length of 1,024 audio samples, on our 22,050 Hz audio). Before use in the classifier, the values of the spectrogram S are converted to a log-scale representation, using the formula ln(A + B * S). For CityBioNet the parameters A = 0. 001 and B = 10. 0 are used, while for CityAnthroNet the parameters A = 0. 025 and B = 2. 0 are used. These parameters are chosen manually to emphasise biotic and anthropogenic sounds by visually inspecting the transformed spectrograms.

CQ: What are the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g, Flipping, Rotating, Scaling)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query.

CQ: What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g, MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)?
Answer: The deep learning pipeline uses the CitySounds2017 dataset, an expert-annotated dataset of urban sounds collected across Greater London, UK. This dataset was used to train the CNNs, CityBioNet and CityAnthroNet, for measuring audible (0-12 kHz) biotic and anthropogenic acoustic activity in audio recordings from urban environments.

CQ: What preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model (e.g., normalization, scaling, cleaning)?
Answer: The preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization is a technique often applied as part of data preparation for machine learning. It is a process that changes the values of numeric columns in the dataset to a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values or losing information. Scaling is a feature scaling technique in which values are rescaled so that they end up ranging between 0 and 1. Cleaning is the process of removing or correcting erroneous data from a dataset. %Context work consisted of a 32 × 21 × 4 tensor. Foundation, 2016) using theano v. 0. 9. 0 (The Theano Development 5.

Raw audio (1), recorded in the field, is converted to a spectrogram representation (2). A sliding window is run across the time dimension, and a window of the spectrogram extracted at each step (3). This spectrogram window is preprocessed with four different normalisation strategies, and the results concatenated. This stack of spectrograms is passed through a CNN (5), which was trained on CitySounds2017train. The CNN gives, at each 1- s time step, a prediction of the presence/absence of biotic or anthropogenic acoustic activity (6). Finally, these per- time- step measures can be aggregated to give summaries over time or space (7) of 1,024 audio samples, on our 22,050 Hz audio).

The NDSI generates a measure of anthropogenic disturbance according to the formula: We used CityNet to generate daily average patterns of biotic and anthropogenic acoustic activity for two study sites across an urbani- sation gradient (sites E29RR and IG62XL with high and low urbani- sation, respectively, Supporting Information Table S1). To control were computed for the average precision under all the threshold However, advances in low- shot learning (e. g. , Wang, Girshick, Hebert, & Hariharan, 2018) may allow our annotations to be used to create such a fine- grained classifier in the future. 2. 3 | Acoustic testing dataset and evaluation 2. 5 | Performance evaluation To evaluate the performance of the CityNet algorithms, we cre- ated a testing dataset (CitySounds2017test) by selecting 40 1- min recordings from CitySounds2017 from the remaining 30% of sites (19 sites, average 2 ± 1 recordings per site).

Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is to generate measures of biotic and anthropogenic acoustic activity. The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) and is part of the CityNet system. The CNN is trained on a large dataset of annotated audio recordings collected across Greater London, UK. The CNN is used to predict the presence or absence of biotic or anthropogenic acoustic activity in each 1-second chunk of audio. The predictions can then be aggregated to give summaries over time or space.
