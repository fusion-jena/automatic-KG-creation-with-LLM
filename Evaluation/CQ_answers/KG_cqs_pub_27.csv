6,"What preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model (e.g., normalization, scaling, cleaning)?","Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved. These can include: 1. Data cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any errors, inconsistencies, or missing values in the dataset. 2. Data normalization or standardization: This involves scaling the data to a common range or distribution, such as between 0 and 1 or with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. This can help improve the performance and convergence of the model. 3. Data transformation: This involves converting the data into a format that is more suitable for the model, such as one-hot encoding categorical variables or converting text data into numerical vectors. 4. Data splitting: This involves dividing the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the test set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model. 5. Data augmentation: This involves creating new training examples by applying random transformations to the existing data, such as rotations, translations, or flips. This can help improve the generalization and robustness of the model. 6. Feature selection or engineering: This involves selecting or creating the most relevant and informative features for the model, such as extracting features from images or text or combining multiple features into a single feature. These preprocessing steps can vary depending on the specific dataset and task, and may require domain- specific knowledge or expertise. ",Generalized

22,"What metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)?","The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of predictions. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both. ",TRUE
17,"What are the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., dropout, L2 regularization)?","The regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline include dropout, L1 regularization, L2 regularization, and early stopping. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents overfitting. L1 regularization adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function, while L2 regularization adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function. Early stopping is a technique where training is stopped when the validation error starts to increase, which helps to prevent overfitting. ",Generalized
