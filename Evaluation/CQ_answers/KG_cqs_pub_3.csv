2,"What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV)?","The deep learning pipeline uses image data formats, specifically spectrograms, for the classification challenges. ",TRUE
5,"What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)? ","The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that TensorFlow was trained on all images (i. e. , 400 spectrograms) from Challenge 1 as an image reference library. Additionally, it is mentioned that Inception v3 was trained on > 1 M images from the ImageNet database. Therefore, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are spectrograms and ImageNet. ",Partly
6,"What preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model (e.g., normalization, scaling, cleaning)?","The context does not provide specific information on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include normalization, scaling, and cleaning of the data. Normalization is the process of adjusting the values of numeric columns in the dataset to a common scale, without distorting the ranges of values or losing information. Scaling is the process of rescaling the values of numeric columns in the dataset to a standard range, such as 0 to 1 or -1 to 1. Cleaning is the process of removing or correcting errors, inconsistencies, and missing values in the dataset. These preprocessing steps can help improve the performance and accuracy of the deep learning model. ",FALSE
