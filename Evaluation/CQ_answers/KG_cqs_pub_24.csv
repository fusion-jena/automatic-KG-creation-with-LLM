2,"What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV)?","The deep learning pipeline uses audio data. The audio data is converted to a Mel spectrogram representation with 32 frequency bins, represented as rows in the spectrogram, using a temporal resolution of 21 columns per second of raw audio. Each column in the spectrogram is computed by running the fast Fourier transform on a section of the audio time signal. Each spectrogram column is computed from 0. 0928 s of audio (which corresponds to a window size of 2,048 samples), and has a Hann window applied. The columns are extracted from the audio signal at a frequency of 21. 53 Hz (or equivalently with a hop length of 1,024 audio samples, on our 22,050 Hz audio). Before use in the classifier, the values of the spectrogram S are converted to a log-scale representation, using the formula ln(A + B * S). For CityBioNet the parameters A = 0. 001 and B = 10. 0 are used, while for CityAnthroNet the parameters A = 0. 025 and B = 2. 0 are used. These parameters are chosen manually to emphasise biotic and anthropogenic sounds by visually inspecting the transformed spectrograms. ",TRUE
5,"What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)? ","The deep learning pipeline uses the CitySounds2017 dataset, an expert-annotated dataset of urban sounds collected across Greater London, UK. This dataset was used to train the CNNs, CityBioNet and CityAnthroNet, for measuring audible (0-12 kHz) biotic and anthropogenic acoustic activity in audio recordings from urban environments. ",TRUE
6,"What preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model (e.g., normalization, scaling, cleaning)?","The preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization is a technique often applied as part of data preparation for machine learning. It is a process that changes the values of numeric columns in the dataset to a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values or losing information. Scaling is a feature scaling technique in which values are rescaled so that they end up ranging between 0 and 1. Cleaning is the process of removing or correcting erroneous data from a dataset.

22,"What metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)?","The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using precision and recall metrics. The fraction of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives were also computed, using the same threshold. These analyses were conducted in python v. 2. 7. 12 using scikit-learn v. 0. 18. 1 and matplotlib v. 1. 5. The experiments were run on a machine running Ubuntu 16. 04 with a 3. 60 GHz Xeon processor, 64 GB of RAM, and a 2 GB Nvidia GPU. ",TRUE

The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) and is part of the CityNet system. The CNN is trained on a large dataset of annotated audio recordings collected across Greater London, UK. The CNN is used to predict the presence or absence of biotic or anthropogenic acoustic activity in each 1-second chunk of audio. The predictions can then be aggregated to give summaries over time or space. ",TRUE
