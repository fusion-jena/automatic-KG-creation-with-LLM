The regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline are dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents overfitting. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is a method that adds a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages large weights and helps to prevent overfitting.
