The annotated dataset AnnotationsActions is split randomly (but fixed for all experiments and all networks) into a train set, validation set, and test set. The test set includes 20% of the video clips of each class. Of the remaining clips, again 20% of the clips in each class form the validation set. The remaining clips are the training set.
