 The pipeline uses a Mask R-CNN model, which is a type of deep learning model that is an extension
of the Faster R-CNN algorithm for generating regions of interest. Mask R-CNN not only detects a
target object in an image but also rapidly detects the pixel-level target region of interest,
outputting a high-resolution segmentation contour reflecting the specific boundaries of the location
of the target object within the image.
