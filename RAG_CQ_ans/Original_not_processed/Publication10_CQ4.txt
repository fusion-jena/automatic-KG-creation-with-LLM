 The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are small random rotations
between -5 and 5 degrees as well as random displacements at the maximum of the 10% of the image.
Although this is a large displacement to apply in order to accommodate within-species vocal
variations, it was decided to use it and proved beneficial probably because a global bird detector
was made and not one dedicated to a specific species.
