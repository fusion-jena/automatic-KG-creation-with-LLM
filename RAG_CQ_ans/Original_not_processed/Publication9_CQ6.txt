 The context does not provide specific information on the preprocessing steps involved before
training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include
normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves scaling the input data to a specific
range, typically between 0 and 1. Scaling involves adjusting the range of the input data to improve
the performance of the model. Cleaning involves removing or correcting any errors or inconsistencies
in the input data.
