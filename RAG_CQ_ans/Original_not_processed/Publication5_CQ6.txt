 Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved. These
can include normalization, which scales the input data to a specific range, often between 0 and 1 or
-1 and 1. Scaling is another common step, which can involve techniques like standardization or min-
max scaling to ensure that all features have a similar scale. Cleaning the data is also important,
which can involve handling missing values, removing outliers, or dealing with inconsistent data.
Other preprocessing steps can include encoding categorical variables, feature selection, or data
augmentation. The specific preprocessing steps used can depend on the nature of the data and the
requirements of the deep learning model.
