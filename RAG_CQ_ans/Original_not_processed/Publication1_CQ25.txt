 The purpose of the deep learning model is to classify the presence or absence and activity rates of
a number of different endangered species, or in some cases, the sounds of birds colliding with
energy infrastructure. In total, the model has the ability to classify dozens of species signals and
event types across ongoing projects, and aims to scale this up to encompass whole communities.
