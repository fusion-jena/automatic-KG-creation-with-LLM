 Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are often involved. These can
include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization is a technique used to change the values
of numeric columns in the dataset to a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of
values or losing information. Scaling is a method used to standardize the range of independent
variables or features of data. Cleaning is the process of removing or correcting erroneous data from
a dataset. However, the specific preprocessing steps can vary depending on the dataset and the model
being used. In this study, the herbarium scans were rescaled from their original average size of ca.
5100 by 3500 pixels to 1200 by 800 pixels, in order to preserve the aspect ratio of the scans and to
speed up the learning by reducing the number of pixels.
