 The purpose of the deep learning model is for coral reef classification. The activation vectors of
the first fully connected layer of a pre-trained VGGnet are employed as feature representations in
this work. The weights of this deep network are fine-tuned using the Benthoz15 dataset, which
consists of expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian seas. The main
contributions of this paper include a method to learn features using a CNN for coral reef
classification and automatic annotation of unlabelled coral images and mosaics from the Abrolhos
Islands in Western Australia.
