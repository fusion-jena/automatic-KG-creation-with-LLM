 The hyperparameters of the model were optimized using Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer with a
learning rate of 0.0025 and momentum of 0.9. The anchor generator in the Region Proposal Network had
six anchor scales [32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024] (square root of area in absolute pixels) each with
three aspect ratios of [1:2, 1:1, 2:1]. The thresholds for non-maximum suppression (NMS) were 0.6
for training and 0.25 for testing, respectively.
